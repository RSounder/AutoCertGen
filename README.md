# AutoCertGen
This simple python script uses cv2 to create and mail certificates to participants of workshops.

Just collect the names and email ids of participants in a csv file (i used google docs), and place it in the project folder as given and run the script!

Make sure to have 'Allow less secured apps' enabled for your gmail for smtp auth!
